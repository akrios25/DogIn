### Technical Mastery Final
 There were multiple parts of the final I wasn't able to complete in a timely matter because I had several setbacks in 
 my build gradle and setting up XML design. The XML design also was a major setback in that it caused my entire app to not run. 
 In the end, I managed to setup a scrollable cardview that contained images of the breeds, as well as implemendted login activity 
logic and intents. I am familiar with how to make networking calls and recyclerviews, however I was not able to get up to that. 
Apart from that, other time consuming tasks that I couldn't be bothered to fully accomplish for the sake of time was organizing everything
in my resource files i.e strings, dimensions, etc. 
Overall, with the appropriate amount of time, I would have been able to deliver a functioning MVP with necessary constraints as instructed.
Looking forward to the retake
